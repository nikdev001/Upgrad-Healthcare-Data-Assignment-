## Objective

The primary goal of this notebook is to develop a **Named Entity Recognition (NER)** model for healthcare data. The aim is to identify and classify specific entities, such as medical conditions, treatments, or anatomical terms, within unstructured text. This task is crucial for transforming raw healthcare text data into structured and actionable insights.

### What Are We Achieving?

1. **Processing Healthcare Text**: Understanding and preparing healthcare text data for machine learning tasks.
2. **NER Model Development**: Training a model to identify and classify entities like diseases, medications, and treatments.
3. **Structured Data Creation**: Converting unstructured text data into a structured format that is easier to analyze.
4. **Performance Evaluation**: Evaluating the accuracy of the model using metrics like precision, recall, and F1-score.
5. **Improved Healthcare Insights**: Enhancing the ability to extract meaningful insights from clinical and healthcare-related text.

### Applications

- **Clinical Data Analysis**: Extract entities like diseases, symptoms, or medications from clinical notes for patient profiling.
- **Healthcare Research**: Automate the organization of research papers or clinical trials based on specific topics.
- **Medical Record Processing**: Support in creating structured electronic health records (EHRs) from unstructured text.

## Structure of the Notebook

1. **Introduction**
   - Overview of entity recognition in healthcare.
   - Importance of named entity recognition (NER) for healthcare applications.

2. **Workspace Setup**
   - Installation and import of necessary Python packages (e.g., SpaCy, pandas, etc.).
   - Note: Ensure that the `spacy` model `en_core_web_sm` is downloaded using the command:
     ```
     !python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
     ```

3. **Data Loading**
   - Explanation of datasets (`train_sent`, `train_label`, `test_sent`, `test_label`).
   - Loading and preprocessing steps for healthcare-related sentences and labels.

4. **Model Training**
   - Implementation of an NER model for entity recognition.
   - Training process using labeled healthcare data.

5. **Evaluation**
   - Evaluation of the model's performance using appropriate metrics.

6. **Conclusion**
   - Summary of the results and potential improvements.
